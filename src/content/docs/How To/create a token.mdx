This tutorial describes the process of creating a basic fungible token on Magi.

<Aside type="note" title="Prior Reading">
This guide assumes that you have read the smart contract development guide [here](/how-to/smart-contract-development).
</Aside>

## Setup

Clone the Magi token contract template:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vsc-eco/magi_token_contract your-token
cd your-token
```

## Deploy Token

Compile your token contract:

```sh
tinygo build -gc=custom -scheduler=none -panic=trap -no-debug -target=wasm-unknown -o build/main.wasm ./contract
wasm-tools strip -o build/main-striped.wasm build/main.wasm
```

Then deploy the contract:

```sh
# If not done already, init config and fill in deployer active key
contract-deployer -init

# Deploy token
contract-deployer -wasmPath build/main-striped.wasm -name "your token name"
```

## Initialize Token

Call the `init` function from your token contract owner address (contract deployer if not specified) with the following payload:

```json
{"name":"Token Name","symbol":"TKN","decimals":3,"maxSupply":1000000000}
```

## Mint Tokens

Call the `mint` function from the token owner address with the below payload. The tokens minted will be sent to your address.

```json
{"amount":1000}
```

## Burn Tokens

Call the `burn` function with the below payload. The tokens will be burnt from the caller address.

```json
{"amount":500}
```

## Transfer Tokens

Call the `transfer` function with the below payload specifying the destination address and amount.

```json
{"to":"hive:recipient","amount":100}
```
