The VSC network supports various account types for authentication.

## DID | Private/ Public key

You can authenticate yourself with an _ed25519_ compatible private/ public key pair.

For a tutorial on how to generate such keys, please take a look at [this document](../how-to/generate-wallet.md).  

## HIVE

You can directly use your [HIVE](https://hive.io/) account to communicate with the VSC network.

To register a HIVE account, you need someone with an existing account to invite you to the network.  

This is also offered as a service by various providers. For more information, please take a look at [HIVE's signup page](https://signup.hive.io/).

## ETH

We do support Ethereum based wallets.

Create your Ethereum wallet via a [known provider](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) with access to your keys. We only support self-custodial wallets.
