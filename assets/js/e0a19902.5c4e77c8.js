VSC operates as sidechain to Hive, this gives us a significant amount of flexibility to advance and build new features, along with the ability to scale the L2 network in the future. Using Hive as a clearing and synchronization method, VSC can push huge amounts of data with little to no overhead on the Hive L1. This approach allows VSC to inherit a lot of Hive's lower level functions such as feeless transactions and 3s block time.
