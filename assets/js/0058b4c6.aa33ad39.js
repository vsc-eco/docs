This design standardizes routing paths, simplifies liquidity provisioning, and reduces risk exposure due to all pools only having 1-sided volatility. By using HBD as the common pair, liquidity providers are only exposed to the performance of their chosen volatile asset paired with HBD. This results in a portfolio that reflects the performance of the single volatile asset rather than multiple sources of price volatility, improving predictability and risk management.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"VSC documentation/Using VSC":{"id":"VSC documentation/Using VSC","title":"Using VSC","description":"Introduction of concepts that help make sense of services VSC is able to provide.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
