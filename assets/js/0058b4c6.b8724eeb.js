This design standardizes routing paths, simplifies liquidity provisioning, and reduces risk exposure due to all pools only having 1-sided volatility. By using HBD as the common pair, liquidity providers are only exposed to the performance of their chosen volatile asset paired with HBD. This results in a portfolio that reflects the performance of the single volatile asset rather than multiple sources of price volatility, improving predictability and risk management.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Technology/Cross-Chain Architecture":{"id":"Technology/Cross-Chain Architecture","title":"Cross-Chain Architecture","description":"This section describes how VSC interfaces with external blockchains, processes inbound transactions, manages vaults, and ensures security during cross-chain operations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Technology/Execution Environment":{"id":"Technology/Execution Environment","title":"Execution Environment","description":"VSC executes transactions and smart contract logic using a deterministic, high-throughput runtime built on modern blockchain architecture standards.
