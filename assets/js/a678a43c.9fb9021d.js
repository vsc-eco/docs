Currently, the goal is to build a full fleged wrapping system for the above cryptocurrency. However, this might not work for all cryptocurrencies or all assets. As a result VSC has support for atomic cross chain swaps using HTLCs. HTLCs, a fundamental feature of VSC, enable secure and trustless cross-chain transactions. With HTLC support, users can lock up assets on one blockchain while simultaneously generating a cryptographic proof that unlocks the equivalent amount on HIVE, seamlessly bridging the two ecosystems, therefore ultimately contributing to a more integrated and versatile crypto landscape."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The full fleged wrapping approach we are going for is based off the ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://xclaim.io",children:"xclaim.io framework"}),".
