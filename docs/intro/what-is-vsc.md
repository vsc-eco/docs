# What is VSC?

The VSC network is like the latest smart contract system on HIVE, all set to supercharge the upcoming generation of HIVE DAPPs. The HIVE blochchain community has been struggling for a while because it couldn't easily create, manage, or run smart contracts, whether at its core or on a similar L2 platform. VSC is here to change all of that in a big way. It's like providing DAPPs with a versatile toolbox to customize, innovate, and reuse smart contracts hassle-free. With VSC in the picture, HIVE is on the brink of becoming a thriving ecosystem ready for expansion.
