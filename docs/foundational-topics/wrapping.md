# Wrapping

VSC's mission extends beyond its innovative consensus mechanisms and executor pools. It aspires to become the driving force behind the integration of various cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, into the HIVE ecosystem through a process known as wrapping. This approach paves the way for the seamless transfer and utilization of Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies within the HIVE network.

VSC's ambitious roadmap includes plans for extending this wrapping capability to Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and potentially more digital assets. While this approach may not be the perfect solution for all scenarios, VSC is ready to facilitate most of these integrations, thanks to its robust support for Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs).

HTLCs, a fundamental feature of VSC, enable secure and trustless cross-chain transactions. They serve as the core for wrapping Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies onto the HIVE network. With HTLC support, users can lock up assets on one blockchain while simultaneously generating a cryptographic proof that unlocks the equivalent amount on HIVE, seamlessly bridging the two ecosystems, therefore ultimately contributing to a more integrated and versatile crypto landscape.
