VSC on its layer 2 supports _ed25519_ compatible wallets. Those are called lite accounts in the context of VSC. They can be generated in various ways. Below you have the current recommended options.

## Official wallet generator

The offical recommended way to generate a lite account is via the wallet generator repository.

It is based on NodeJS and is fairly lightweight.  

Clone the repository, install the node modules and run the generator.

Take a look at [the repository here](https://github.com/vsc-eco/wallet-generator).
